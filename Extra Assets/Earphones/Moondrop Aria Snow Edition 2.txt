MOONDROP has a new dynamic driver used here that goes with a dual cavity and a 10 mm DLC (diamond-like carbon) diaphragm. This is a departure from the previous Aria's 10 mm LCP (liquid crystalline polymer) diaphragm driver, and is instead the same driver tech used in the older MOONDROP Kanas Pro that slotted in at $180 when it launched. Call it tech-cycling if you wish, and note that the diaphragm is paired with an imported Daifoku CCAW (copper clad aluminium wire) voice coil, a brass inner cavity, a high-frequency waveguide structure and presumably also the same neodymium N52 magnets as before. These come together to make the new Aria Snow Edition slightly more demanding than the average set of IEMs, including the Aria (2021), with a rated impedance of 32 Î© and sensitivity of 119 dB/Vrms (104 dB/mW).
